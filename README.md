These are my Neovim dotfiles. 

They're based on what @theprimeagen and TJ did on a couple of videos, so not a lot of original config. 
The important part is, they work. 

What do you get?

* LSP
* Completion
* Debugging
* Colors, statusbar and winbar. 
* Nice Git integration (blame inline and displayed the gutter)
* Treesitter 
* rust and js debugging support
* ...and also a lot of crap you may not need.
